      <h3>Academic Background</h3>
      <p>
        I am a Mathematician (B.S. from UNICEN, Argentina) specializing in the intersection of Large Language Models
        (LLMs) and Automated Theorem Proving (ATP). My research focuses on auto-formalization: using neural models to
        bridge the gap between natural language mathematics and formal verification systems like Lean 4 and Coq.
